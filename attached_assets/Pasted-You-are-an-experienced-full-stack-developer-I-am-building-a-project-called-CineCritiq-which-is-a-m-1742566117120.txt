You are an experienced full-stack developer. I am building a project called CineCritiq, which is a movie review and recommendation platform inspired by Letterboxd.

Project Overview:
CineCritiq will allow users to:

Discover movies from a vast directory with details like title, synopsis, genres, cast, ratings, and reviews.
Read and write reviews, rate movies, and interact with other users.
Get recommendations based on selected movies (similar movies feature).
Search for movies using a search bar with auto-suggestions.
Browse curated lists, such as:
Trending Movies
Greatest of All Time
Highly Rated
Top by Genre (Action, Drama, Sci-Fi, etc.)
Critics' Picks
Technical Requirements:
Frontend: Modern UI similar to Letterboxd using React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Backend: A robust backend using Node.js with Express.js or NestJS.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data, movie details, reviews, and ratings.
Authentication: User login/signup via email/password or OAuth (Google/GitHub login).
API Integration: Fetch movie details from a reliable source like TMDb.
Recommendation System: Implement a movie recommendation algorithm using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
Additional Features:
User Profiles with a list of watched movies, reviews, and ratings.
Movie Lists & Collections (users can create custom lists).
Dark Mode Support for an aesthetic UI.
Tasks:
Design the UI using React/Next.js with Letterboxd-inspired aesthetics.
Develop the backend API using Node.js and Express/NestJS.
Set up the database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for storing user data and movie details.
Implement authentication with JWT or OAuth.
Integrate a movie API (e.g., TMDb) to fetch movie details dynamically.
Develop a recommendation system for suggesting movies based on user preferences.
Deploy the application on Vercel/Netlify (frontend) and Render/Fly.io (backend).
Please generate code for the frontend, backend, and database setup, ensuring scalability and best practices.
